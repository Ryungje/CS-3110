(** Test Plan

    Module Cards - tested automaticlaly by OUnit. The test cases were
    developed using both black box and glass box testing to check if the
    return values are correct. However, [shuffle] is randomed set of
    cards, so it simply a property test that the set is equivalent to
    the orginal set and the ordering of the list is printed out to
    console to check whether or not each shuffle is different from
    previous shuffle (i.e. does not produce same order every time).

    Module Player - tested automatically by OUnit. The test cases were
    developed using black box testing to check all the edge and normal
    cases. Some of the generator functions return abstract type player,
    so the data contained within each [player] is mass tested using
    multiple query functions to ensure only one or two specific values
    are changed by the function according to the specification of the
    function.

    Module Commands - tested automatically by OUnit. The test cases were
    devleoped using both black box testing and glass box testing to
    check if the proper exceptions and commands are returned depending
    on the input. It tests whether or not the parsing functions can
    handle unusual inputs (note: inputs are case sensitive).

    Module State - tested by OUnit and QCheck. Functions [init_state],
    [deal],[reset_all],[complete_hand],[increase_bet], and [redeem_bet]
    are tested using OUnit using black box testing to check only a
    specific value of a specifc player is changed. Uses the query
    functions [players_of], [dealer_of], [remaining_deck], and
    [list_of_players] to check the values (note: the output of the query
    functions may be abstract type, where the data in the abstract types
    can be extracted with query functions from the Player or Cards
    module). Functions [increase_insurance] and [redeem_insurace]
    together using OUnit black box testing because the property of
    having an insurance is not retrievable, but the end total of chips
    can be extracted after [redeem_insurance] is check whether or not
    the total is updated corrected for the amount added by
    [increase_insurance]. Functions [unnatural_dealer_natural_player],
    [natural_dealer_unnatural_player], [change_ace], [split_hand],
    [swap_hand], and [double_down] are functions that can only be called
    under certain conditions (i.e. a specific type of hand of cards) as
    the preconditions. These functions are tested under QCheck where
    many randomizd states are created and checked to see if it meet the
    proper precondition. If the randomly generated state meets the
    precondition, then the property test will be carried out. Since a
    large number of states is created for each test, it is very probably
    that at least one of the states will meet the property (ex:
    probability of getting dealth a pair is 1/17).

    Module Instructions - not tested because it is only two functions
    that print out instructions or definitions of terminologies to the
    console. The formatting of the print is tested using the interface. *)
